In this project, we made a ML model for face mask detection and used a GSM module to send notification to user's mobile phone and made a protoype robot, which brings you a face mask.

The Untitled.py is a python file which uses jupyter notebook as the development environmnet, before runnning up the codes, install the required dependcies, thus you can minimize the errors.

We have face mask detection part, coming to the applications one, we have used Arduino and it's IDE
